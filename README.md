## 🚀 How to Try / See My Work

1. Clone or download my portfolio repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser for the live demo.  
3. Make sure your internet connection is active if external resources (fonts, Bootstrap, Swiper) are loaded via CDNs.  
4. Resize the browser or test on different devices to see responsiveness.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learning

- Ensuring consistent look across screen sizes  
- Managing dependencies (Bootstrap, SwiperJS) without bloating the design  
- Fine-tuning visual styles: spacing, typography, contrast  
- Keeping the site performant and smooth

## ⭐ What I’m Working On

- Completing the “Mods Restaurant” design and launching it fully  
- Adding more interactive features (hover effects, transitions)  
- Possibly integrating backend or dynamic content later  
- Continuous improvements to mobile/UX
